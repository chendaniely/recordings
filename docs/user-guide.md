# Using recordings

A plain how-to: one section per screen or task, with what you see and what to do. The runbook
(`docs/runbooks/first-run.md`) has the server-side detail; this guide links to it rather than
copying it. Stage 2b's sections are added as each part is built, and finished at its end.

## Signing in to Plaud

The server's sync reads your recordings from Plaud with a sign-in that only the server's `worker`
holds. You make it from the Mac, and the server keeps it fresh by itself.

**What you see**

- **Status** says "sign-in needed" when the server has no sign-in, or Plaud has refused it. New
  recordings wait on Plaud until you sign in again; nothing is lost.
- About 2 hours after the sync stops, Healthchecks emails that the sync's check is down.
- `recordings doctor --role worker`, on the server, says "sign-in needed: run `make plaud-sign-in`",
  or warns a week before the sign-in's refresh token expires.

**What to do**

1. On the Mac, at the repo's top, check that `local.mk` names the server (`SERVER = …`) and the
   repo's checkout there (`REPO_DIR = …`). `make consent-add` uses the same file.
2. Run `make plaud-sign-in`. A browser opens: sign in to Plaud there.
3. It ends with one line: "signed in: yes · access token expires … · refresh token: present ·
   account 1a2b3c4d". The account is shown as a short code, never your e-mail.
4. To check from the server at any time: `rc exec worker recordings plaud check`.

If it stops with "step 2 failed", the browser sign-in didn't finish: run it again. "Step 3 failed"
means the Mac couldn't reach the server. "Step 4 failed" says why the server refused it, and that
nothing was installed. The runbook's "Plaud sign-in" has every message.

The sign-in is a secret. Never copy its file by hand or paste it anywhere, and don't ask a Claude
session to run `make plaud-sign-in` for you: you sign in yourself, in the browser.
